      <h4>Recovery seed length</h4>
      <p>
        Your recovery seed is a sequence of words. It will help you recover your wallet
        (your bitcoins and transaction history), into another device should your TREZOR
        be lost or destoyed.

    <h4>PIN protection</h4>
    <p>
      Using PIN protection is highly recommended. The PIN prevents unauthorized persons from stealing
      your bitcoins if they ever get physical access to your device.
    </p>
    <p>You can reset or change your PIN at any time after the setup is complete.
    Be careful with your recovery card.
    If anyone finds out your recovery seed they can steal your bitcoins even without your PIN.</p>

    <h4>Additional passphrase encryption</h4>
    <p>Using an encryption passphrase adds an additional level of security.
      You'll be asked for your passphrase every time you want to access your
      wallet.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning alert-withicon">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign alert-icon"></span>
      <h4>Passphrase encryption is for experts only. Proceed with caution!</h4>
      <p>Passphrase works like a 25th word of the seed which is not stored in
      the Trezor. If you forget your passphrase, your wallet is lost for good. There is
      absolutely no way to recover your funds.<br>
      <p>If you mistype your passphrase, a different wallet is created, which
      will look as if you had 0 BTC on your account.</p>
      <p>If you choose to use passphrase encryption now, you cannot turn it
      off later and vice versa (if you choose not to use it, you cannot turn it
      on later).</p>
